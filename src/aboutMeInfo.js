const personalText = "Hello, I'm Jason Zamora.  I am an aspiring full stack developer/artist. When I'm not working on web development or my artistic skills, I can usually be found hitting the weights or videogaming.  Currently, I'm cycling through Albion Online, Dirt Rally 2, Marvel StrikeForce, Kingdom of HeckFire, and FightNight Champion.  Overall my philosophy on life is that we are our greatest oppressors and by constantly improving ourselves we discover our strengths.  I apply this to just about everything.  They say 'Teamwork makes the dream work',to which I'd add, 'moreso if the teammates strive to improve themselves too'.";

const professionalText = "I have 10 years of customer support experience assisting via email/chat/phone. I have worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript for the greater part of 7yrs and am an aspiring full stack developer. In my experience, I frequently work with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Handlebars.js, Socket.io, GSAP (library),React, and Sass. I'm also familiar with versioning via Git and API creation. In addition to my focus on web development technology, I'm also skilled at vector/raster design, using Illustrator/Inkscape and SVG, in general. On my spare time, if I'm not learning or working on one of several web-based projects, I'm improving my illustration skills. As a developer, I seek to be the 'glue' between front/ backend teams. My current endeavors are focused on gaining proficiency on GraphQL both front and backend..NOTE: I, unfortunately ,do not have professional work experience just yet but I do work well with teams.";
