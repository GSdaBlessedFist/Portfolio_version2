const professionalText = "I have 10 years of customer support experience assisting via email/chat/phone. I have worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript for the greater part of 7yrs and am an aspiring full stack developer. In my experience, I frequently work with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Handlebars.js, Socket.io, GSAP (library),React, and Sass. I'm also familiar with versioning via Git and API creation. In addition to my focus on web development technology, I'm also skilled at vector/raster design, using Illustrator/Inkscape and SVG, in general. On my spare time, if I'm not learning or working on one of several web-based projects, I'm improving my illustration skills. As a developer, I seek to be the 'glue' between front/ backend teams. My current endeavors are focused on gaining proficiency on GraphQL both front and backend..NOTE: I, unfortunately ,do not have professional work experience just yet but I do work well with teams.";
